It was harder to access and search libraries for the information needed. Many required reservations to access, where you may have had to wait for months before you could visit, not to mention the travel time. Thanks to technology and the internet, we've got better access to sources and digital libraries of information for our studies which allows us to search for information in a more efficient way.
