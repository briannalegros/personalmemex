> Links are associative. This is a huge deal. Links are there not only as a quick way to get to source material. They aren’t a way to say, hey here’s the interesting thing of the day. They remind you of the questions you need to ask, of the connections that aren’t immediately evident.

Links allow us to connect and network notes. This is an important aspect of the memex, it allows us to create and expand on existing ideas and notes, allowing us to further expand our repository of knowledge.
