### Summary & Key Take Aways

Wiegand summarizes many studies on the origin of the Decimal Classification created by Melvil Dewey. It is shown via these studies that Dewey had taken much inspiration from existing library catalogues and with the help of Amherst College. His system of classification is a product of its time, heavily within an Anglo-Saxon view.
