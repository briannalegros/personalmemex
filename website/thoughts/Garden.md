> The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.

Cultivating information into a wiki or memex is like cultivating a garden. This metaphor connects these to ideas together. The garden of information relies on the gardener to arrange and take care of that information.
